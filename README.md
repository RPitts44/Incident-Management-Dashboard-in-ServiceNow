Purpose: Build an Incident Management Dashboard in ServiceNow for Enhanced Visibility

As a: ServiceNow Administrator or IT Operations Manager,
I want to: create an Incident Management Dashboard in ServiceNow,
So that: I can visualize incident trends, monitor resolution times, and categorize incidents effectively in real-time.

Acceptance Criteria:

Setup:
A ServiceNow developer instance is successfully created and configured.
The "Incident" module is accessible and populated with demo or sample data.

Dashboard Creation:
A new dashboard titled "Incident Management Dashboard" is created under the "Self-Service" > "Dashboards" section.

Key widgets are added to display:

- Incident trends over time.
- Open incidents categorized by type.
- Average resolution times of incidents.

Customization:

- Widgets are configured to fetch real-time data and reflect accurate metrics.
- The dashboard layout is tailored to user roles and preferences.

Testing:

- Sample incident scenarios (e.g., different priorities or categories) are simulated.
- Dashboard metrics update dynamically and reflect test scenarios accurately.

Documentation:
Steps to create, customize, and test the dashboard are documented for reproducibility.

Additional Notes:

- This project will leverage sample data to minimize costs.
- The dashboard will serve as a foundational tool for IT teams to manage incidents efficiently and gain actionable insights into incident management processes.

The Incident Management Dashboard provides a real-time overview of incidents within an organization, displaying key metrics such as incident volume, resolution time, priority levels, and status. It helps teams monitor and manage ongoing incidents, track trends, and ensure timely resolution. This dashboard enables efficient resource allocation, improved response times, and enhanced visibility into the incident management process.
